PGT (Python GROMACS Toolkit, version 0.1)
=========================================

This is a toolbox written in Python to ease the work with GROMACS.
It is documented via the docstring-feature of Python.

This toolkit is currently very much a work in progress and
not to be considered being an end-product of any kind.
Publication is done in hope to inspire / ease someone else's work or to
help him/her not having to reinvent the wheel.

Most of the stuff implemented is directly related to my work as a grad student in
the field of biomolecular dynamics. If you, however, find this stuff useful,
implement further functionality, add comments or (most important) find bugs,
feel free to contact me via email or github.
